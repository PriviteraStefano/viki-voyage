Albania wasn't on my original travel list, but a friend's enthusiastic recommendation changed that. "It's Europe's best-kept secret," she insisted. After two weeks exploring this Balkan beauty, I understand why locals half-joke that they want to keep Albania to themselves.

## Tirana's Colorful Surprises

Albania's capital, Tirana, defied my expectations completely. The city's buildings are painted in vibrant colors – a project started by former mayor (and later prime minister) Edi Rama. The rainbow facades transformed what could be dreary communist-era buildings into an outdoor art gallery.

Skanderbeg Square forms the city's heart, surrounded by the National History Museum, the Opera House, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque. I spent an afternoon at Bunk'Art 2, a museum inside a massive Cold War bunker that tells Albania's communist history. It was sobering and fascinating in equal measure.

Tirana's café culture surprised me. Locals spend hours at outdoor cafés, nursing tiny cups of strong coffee and watching the world go by. The Blloku neighborhood, once restricted to communist elite, now buzzes with trendy restaurants, bars, and shops. I quickly adopted the local pace, lingering over meals and embracing conversation with strangers.

## The Albanian Riviera

The coastal drive along the Albanian Riviera ranks among the most beautiful I've experienced. Starting from Vlorë and heading south toward Sarandë, each turn revealed dramatic views of turquoise water meeting rugged mountains.

I fell in love with Dhërmi, a small village perched on a hillside above stunning beaches. The water was impossibly clear, the beaches weren't crowded, and seafood restaurants served the freshest fish I'd ever tasted – all at prices that seemed too good to be true. I spent days swimming, reading under umbrellas, and watching spectacular sunsets.

Jale Beach and Gjipe Beach (accessible only by foot or boat) offered even more seclusion. Gjipe's dramatic canyon opening to a pristine beach felt like discovering a secret paradise. I hiked down through the canyon, spent hours swimming, and felt grateful to experience such untouched beauty.

## Ancient Butrint

Near Sarandë lies Butrint, a UNESCO World Heritage site that blew me away. This archaeological park contains ruins from Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Venetian periods. Walking through ancient theaters, temples, and fortifications while surrounded by lush forest and wetlands created an almost mystical atmosphere.

The site is remarkably well-preserved yet uncrowded. I spent a morning exploring mostly alone, imagining life in this ancient city. The setting, overlooking a lagoon near the Greek island of Corfu, adds to Butrint's magic.

## Gjirokastër and Berat

Gjirokastër, a UNESCO-listed stone city, transported me back in time. Houses with distinctive stone roofs climb the hillside, and the massive castle dominates the skyline. I stayed in a traditional guesthouse where my host served homemade raki and shared family stories over dinner.

Berat, the "City of a Thousand Windows," was equally captivating. White Ottoman houses stacked on hillsides, their many windows reflecting sunlight, created a stunning sight. I climbed to Berat Castle, discovering a living neighborhood within the fortress walls where families still reside among Byzantine churches.

## Mountain Adventures

Albania's mountains are spectacular. I spent several days in the Albanian Alps (Prokletije), basing myself in Theth. The mountain scenery rivaled anything I'd seen in Switzerland, but without the crowds or high prices. I hiked to the Blue Eye waterfall and across mountain passes, staying in traditional guesthouses where hosts treated me like family.

The hospitality in mountain villages was extraordinary. Hosts insisted on sharing meals, refused payment for coffee, and went out of their way to ensure I had everything I needed. This generosity, rooted in the Albanian tradition of besa (keeping promises and honoring guests), deeply touched me.

## Food and Traditions

Albanian cuisine deserves more recognition. Tavë kosi (baked lamb with yogurt), byrek (savory pastries), and fresh salads with local cheese became daily staples. The food reflects Albania's position between Italy, Greece, and Turkey, incorporating influences from all three.

I learned that when Albanians offer coffee, refusing is nearly impossible. The ritual of coffee, served strong and sweet, accompanies every visit and conversation. I embraced it, slowing down to enjoy these moments of connection.

## The Blue Eye Spring

Near Sarandë, I visited Syri i Kaltër (The Blue Eye), a stunning natural spring. The water is an incredible shade of blue, bubbling up from underground at 10°C year-round. Swimming in the pool (if you can brave the cold) feels otherworldly. The surrounding park, with clear streams and lush vegetation, made for a perfect afternoon.

## Unexpected Discoveries

What struck me most about Albania wasn't just the beaches, mountains, or historical sites – it was the feeling of discovery. Tourism is developing, but Albania hasn't been overrun yet. Locals seemed genuinely happy to share their country, often surprised that foreigners chose to visit.

Conversations with Albanians revealed pride in their country's resilience and optimism about its future. Despite a difficult 20th century, there's an energy and forward momentum that's palpable.

## Value and Accessibility

Albania is incredibly affordable. Excellent meals cost a fraction of Western European prices, accommodation was cheap, and activities were budget-friendly. This allowed me to splurge on experiences without worrying about my budget.

## Final Thoughts

Albania exceeded every expectation. It offered beach paradise, mountain adventures, rich history, delicious food, and some of the warmest hospitality I've encountered anywhere. It's authentic, affordable, and stunningly beautiful.

I left Albania already planning my return. This hidden gem won't stay hidden forever, so if you're looking for your next adventure, go now. Experience Albania before the secret gets out completely.

Mirupafshim, Albania – until we meet again.
